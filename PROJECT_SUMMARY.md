- **Queue boundary indicators** for each checkout counter
- **Color-coded status** (Green=Current, Red=Waiting, Blue=Boundaries)
- **Real-time line updates** as customers move through queues

### 3. **Individual Time Tracking**
- **Service time calculation** for each customer from start to completion
- **Wait time estimation** based on queue position and historical data
- **Real-time timers** displayed on screen during service
- **Performance benchmarking** against target service times

### 4. **Multi-Counter Support**
- **4 checkout counters** (configurable)
- **Express lanes** (Counters 1-2) vs **Regular lanes** (Counters 3-4)
- **Independent queue management** for each counter
- **Counter-specific performance metrics**

### 5. **Performance Monitoring**
- **Cashier performance tracking** with efficiency scores
- **Service time analysis** and trend monitoring
- **Queue efficiency metrics** and bottleneck detection
- **Real-time alerts** for performance issues

### 6. **Visual Interface**
- **Live video overlay** with separation lines and customer boxes
- **Performance dashboard** with real-time metrics
- **Queue status indicators** (Green/Yellow/Red circles)
- **Customer position numbering** and wait time display

### 7. **Analytics & Reporting**
- **Automated hourly reports** with performance summaries
- **Daily comprehensive analysis** with trends and recommendations
- **Manual report generation** on-demand
- **Chart visualization** for performance trends

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies:
- **OpenCV** for computer vision and video processing
- **YOLO (ultralytics)** for accurate person detection
- **NumPy/Pandas** for data processing and analytics
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualization and charts
- **Threading** for background analytics and reporting

### Detection Method:
- Primary: **YOLOv8 nano** for real-time person detection
- Fallback: **HOG descriptor** if YOLO unavailable
- **Confidence thresholding** and **NMS** for accuracy

### Queue Logic:
- **Position-based tracking** using counter area definitions
- **Service line detection** (top 25% of queue area = service zone)
- **Automatic customer progression** through queue positions
- **Time-based service completion** detection

## 🎮 How to Use

### Quick Start:
1. **Setup**: `python setup.py`
2. **Test**: `python test_system.py`
3. **Demo**: `python demo.py`
4. **Live**: `python main.py`

### Controls During Operation:
- **Q** - Quit application
- **S** - Save manual report
- **R** - Reset all counters
- **H** - Show help menu

### Demo Mode Additional:
- **N** - Add new random customers

## 🎯 Real-World Applications

### For Walmart/DMart:
- **Peak hour management** - Identify when to open additional counters
- **Cashier performance** - Track individual efficiency and training needs
- **Customer satisfaction** - Minimize wait times through optimization
- **Operational efficiency** - Data-driven staffing decisions

### Visual Feedback:
- **Store managers** can see real-time queue status at a glance
- **Cashiers** get performance feedback and timing information
- **Customers** benefit from optimized queue flow and shorter waits

## 📊 Analytics Capabilities

## 🔧 Configuration Options

The system is highly configurable through `config.json`:

```json
{
    "detection": {
        "confidence_threshold": 0.5,    # Detection sensitivity
        "model_type": "yolo"            # Detection method
    },
    "queue": {
        "max_customers_per_queue": 10,  # Queue length limits
        "service_time_threshold": 300   # Alert thresholds
    },
    "counters": {
        "total_counters": 4,            # Number of checkout lanes
        "express_lanes": [1, 2],        # Express lane designations
        "counter_positions": {          # Physical layout mapping
            "1": {"x": 100, "y": 200, "width": 200, "height": 400}
        }
    }
}
```
